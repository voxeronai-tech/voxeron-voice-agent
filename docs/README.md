# Voxeron Voice Agent — Development Docs

This `docs/` folder contains **development and operational** documentation for the
`voxeron-voice-agent` repository (runtime code, tests, release handovers).

## Canonical Architecture (Single Source of Truth)

All platform architecture, blueprints, and ADRs live in the separate repository:

- `voxeron-architecture`
- Path: `docs/architecture/`

This repo intentionally does **not** maintain architecture documents to avoid drift.

## What belongs here

- HANDOVER.md (engineering continuation)
- project status / sprint notes
- RC checklists and runbooks relevant to this codebase
- test strategy implementation notes
